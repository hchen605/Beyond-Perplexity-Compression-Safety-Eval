    \caption{Change of representational bias against different groups, as compression ratio increases, with 13B models. Although aggregated bias metric are relatively stable, different protected groups have vastly different behaviors. Results with 7B models show similar trends (\cref{fig:intra_group_heatmap_appendix}).}
